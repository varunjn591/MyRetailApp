# MyRetailApp
myRetail is a rapidly growing company with HQ in Richmond, VA and over 200 stores  across the east coast. myRetail wants to make its internal data available to any number  of client devices, from myRetail.com to native mobile apps.  The goal for this exercise is to create an end-to- end Proof-of- Concept for a products API,  which will aggregate product data from multiple sources and return it as JSON to the  caller.  The goal is to create a RESTful service that can retrieve product and price details by ID.
